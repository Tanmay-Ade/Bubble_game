# Bubble_game

I have created these Bubblegame using Html, Css and Js and some of DOM Properties.

Game Rules :
In this game, players have one minute to press the exact number shown in Hit. 
If the number is correct, their score will increase by 10 and If the number is incorrect, their score decreases by 10.
After Clicking the number hit will change automatically. 

Happy Gaming!
